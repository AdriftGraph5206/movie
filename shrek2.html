    <p><strong>Director:</strong> Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury, Conrad Vernon</p>
    <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Animation, Adventure, Comedy</p>
    <p><strong>Runtime:</strong> 93 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> After their honeymoon, Shrek and Fiona travel to the kingdom of Far Far Away to meet her parents. Their arrival is met with shock, especially from King Harold. Meanwhile, the Fairy Godmother schemes to have her son, Prince Charming, marry Fiona. Shrek must once again prove that true love isn’t about appearances.</p>
    <p><strong>Full Review:</strong> Shrek 2 raises the stakes and delivers an arguably even stronger story than its predecessor. It’s funnier, bigger, and full of emotional moments. The introduction of Puss in Boots is a highlight, and Antonio Banderas gives the character irresistible charm. The film dives deeper into identity and relationships, especially with Shrek’s insecurity about fitting in with Fiona’s royal family. The animation is improved, the soundtrack is brilliant, and the humor is sharper. Fairy Godmother is an iconic villain, and her rendition of “Holding Out for a Hero” is unforgettable. A rare sequel that exceeds expectations.
