    <p><strong>Director:</strong> Chris Miller, Raman Hui</p>
    <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Animation, Adventure, Comedy</p>
    <p><strong>Runtime:</strong> 93 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> With King Harold dying, Shrek is next in line for the throne — a responsibility he doesn’t want. He sets out to find the next heir, Arthur, while Prince Charming rallies fairytale villains to seize the kingdom. Meanwhile, Fiona reveals she’s pregnant, adding to Shrek’s anxiety about fatherhood.</p>
    <p><strong>Full Review:</strong> Shrek the Third struggles under the weight of its predecessors. While it introduces new characters like Arthur (voiced by Justin Timberlake) and explores Shrek’s fear of becoming a father, the story feels less focused and the humor more generic. The film lacks the emotional depth and clever satire that made the first two shine. However, it’s not without charm — Puss, Donkey, and Fiona’s supporting cast still offer laughs, and the visuals remain solid. Ultimately, it’s a fun but forgettable chapter that feels more like a transition than a climax.
