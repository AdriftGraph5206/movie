    <p><strong>Full Review:</strong> The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a colorful, fast-paced adventure packed with nostalgia and fan service. While the story is simple and the character arcs are minimal, the film succeeds by leaning into its video game roots. The animation is gorgeous, capturing the spirit of the games with vivid worlds and iconic references — from Rainbow Road to power-ups. Chris Pratt’s Mario is serviceable, while Jack Black's Bowser steals the show with over-the-top flair (and a surprise musical number). Though it doesn’t dive deep emotionally, it delivers a fun, family-friendly ride that respects its source material and entertains from start to finish.
