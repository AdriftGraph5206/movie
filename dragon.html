    <p><strong>Director:</strong> Dean DeBlois, Chris Sanders</p>
    <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Animation, Action, Adventure</p>
    <p><strong>Runtime:</strong> 98 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In the Viking village of Berk, dragons are feared and hunted. Hiccup, a misfit teenage inventor, wounds a rare Night Fury dragon but can’t bring himself to kill it. Instead, he secretly befriends the creature — Toothless — and learns that everything his people believed about dragons is wrong.</p>
    <p><strong>Full Review:</strong> How to Train Your Dragon is a stunning blend of heart, action, and breathtaking animation. What begins as a coming-of-age tale blossoms into a deep story about empathy, friendship, and challenging traditions. Hiccup’s bond with Toothless is one of the most emotionally resonant relationships in animated film, brought to life with expressive animation and a moving score by John Powell. DreamWorks steps out of its comfort zone with a more earnest tone, creating a timeless fantasy filled with wonder and soul. It’s not just a kids’ movie — it’s a modern animated classic that speaks to all ages.
