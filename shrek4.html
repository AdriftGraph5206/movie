    <p><strong>Director:</strong> Mike Mitchell</p>
    <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Animation, Adventure, Comedy</p>
    <p><strong>Runtime:</strong> 93 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Tired of his routine life and missing the days when he was feared, Shrek makes a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to feel like a real ogre again — but it backfires. He’s thrown into an alternate reality where he never existed, and Fiona leads an ogre resistance. Shrek must fight to reclaim his life and those he loves.</p>
    <p><strong>Full Review:</strong> Shrek Forever After brings the series back to emotional roots, with a darker tone and a more introspective story. It’s about identity, gratitude, and realizing the value of what you have. The alternate-reality twist adds fresh tension, and Rumpelstiltskin makes for a delightfully unhinged villain. Fiona’s warrior version adds depth to her character, and the visual quality is the best in the franchise. While the laughs are fewer and the energy lower than the earlier films, it provides a satisfying and mature conclusion to Shrek’s journey. A fitting farewell with heart and reflection.
